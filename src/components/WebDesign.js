            Web design for the site Picky Eater. For picky eaters and parents of picky eaters who are looking for new
            recipes and trying to expand their/their kidâ€™s palette, Picky Eater is a recipe finding website that lets
            users search for recipes based on their dietary restrictions, allergies, foods they love, and foods they
            hate. Unlike AllRecipes and recipe blogs, Picky Eater has more precise filters, the ability to input
            everything into a profile, and the ability to slowly add food aversions back into the users diet.

            The design process for this site included work flow sketches, creating personas, interviews, a site map,
            wireframes, looking at benchmarks, usability tests, story boards, and a final design prototype.
            My design changed throughout the process to better accommodate the users.
